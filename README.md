### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create or Update Conda Environment**:
   - Ensure you have a Conda environment set up for your project. If not already created, use the `environment.yml` file (or create one if necessary) and run:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - Activate the Conda environment:
     ```bash
     conda activate mywebsite
     ```

2. **Add or Update Content**:
   - Make your changes to the content files (articles, images, etc.) in the Pelican content directory.

3. **Build the Site with Pelican**:
   - Generate the static site files from your content:
     ```bash
     pelican content
     ```

4. **Review the Site Locally (Optional)**:
   - To preview your site locally, start the Pelican development server:
     ```bash
     pelican --listen
     ```
   - View your site in a web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Use `ghp-import` to update the `gh-pages` branch and push it to GitHub:
     ```bash
     ghp-import output -b gh-pages -p
     ```

6. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Check your GitHub repository to ensure the `gh-pages` branch has been updated.
   - Visit your GitHub Pages URL to confirm the site reflects your recent changes.

### Notes

- These steps assume that your Pelican site is set up in a standard way, with content in a `content` directory and the output being generated in an `output` directory.
- The process of creating and updating the Conda environment (Step 1) is typically done once initially and whenever you update your project's dependencies.
- Always ensure your Conda environment is activated before running Pelican commands to ensure all dependencies are correctly used.
- The local review step (Step 4) is optional but recommended to catch any issues before deploying the site.
