I did my PhD at the intersection of **Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning**, working with <a style="color: #00CBB0;text-decoration: none;" href="https://sinzlab.org/people/fabian_sinz.html">Fabian Sinz</a>, where I used deep neural networks, latent variable models, and implicit neural representations, driving insights about functional properties of visual sensory areas.

Before my PhD, I did my bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, in Malaysia, and then moved to Munich to pursue my masters in Neuroengineering at TU Munich.

Leveraging this multidisciplinary background, I've recently joined the <a style="color: #00CBB0;text-decoration: none;" href="https://ibehave.nrw/">iBehave Network</a> to taken on a practical role aimed at bridging the gap between academic research and applied solutions. 
As core members of the <a style="color: #00CBB0;text-decoration: none;" href="https://ibehave.nrw/ibots-platform/about-ibots/">iBOTS facilitation group</a>, we drive tech innovations and knowledge transfer across many neuroscience labs. We focus on **research software development**, as well as running **training** sessions and **community events** to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing, thereby improving both scientific research and technical skills across various academic levels.
