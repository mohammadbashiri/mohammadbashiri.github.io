I did my PhD at the intersection of **Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning**, working with <a style="color: #00CBB0;text-decoration: none;" href="https://sinzlab.org/people/fabian_sinz.html">Fabian Sinz</a>, where I used deep neural networks, latent variable models, and implicit neural representations, driving insights about functional properties of visual sensory areas.

Before my PhD, I did my bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Malaysia, and then moved to Munich to pursue my masters in Neuroengineering at TU Munich.

These days, I am working on advancing data-driven medical solutions at <a style="color: #00CBB0;text-decoration: none;" href="https://noselab.com/">Noselab</a>, a medical startup pioneering a proprietary diagnostic platform to detect, assess, and classify molecular biomarkers through nasal secretion, bridging cutting-edge technology with impactful healthcare applications.
